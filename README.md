# Peppered Moth Evolution

An interactive simulation that models the evolution of the peppered moth (*Biston betularia*) through natural selection. This project demonstrates how environmental changes, such as pollution, can influence the prevalence of certain traits within a population over generations.

## Features

- Simulates genetic variation and inheritance across generations
- Models the impact of environmental pollution on moth coloration survival
- Graphs to track population changes over time
- Adjustable parameters (e.g., mutation rate, pollution level)
- Built with Streamlit for an intuitive user interface
